mediarip
============

Mediarip is able to download videos of the 'ZDFmediathek' fully automatially
and can also transcode them on the fly, if wanted.

Mediarip doesn't require a browser or a graphical interface.

You just have to define the shows which you are interested in.
Each time mediarip is started it checks for new episodes of the defined shows
and will download and transcode them automatically.

Tip: Starting mediarip as a cronjob is recommended for a full automatic setup. 


Dependencies
------------

- some Perl modules

    LWP::UserAgent
    DBI             # only needed, if DATA_STORE_METHOD is set to 'db' in CONFIG

- mencoder          # only needed, if CONVERT is set to 'yes' in CONFIG 
                    # built with libmp3lame, libx264 and libxvidcore  
- mplayer


Cloning
-------

    git clone http://git.sven-burkard.de/mediarip/


Configuring
-----------

You just have to fill the CONFIG file with your values.
Some settings have dependencies to other ones.

If you use a database as DATA_STORE_METHOD, you need to create a database named 'mediarip'
and a user who has access to this database.


Usage
-----

First of all, you need to add some shows, which should be checked for new episodes from mediarip.
So you look for all available shows from one source.

    ./control.pl --list on

One example line of the result could be 'zdf: SOKO_5113'
Now you need to add this entry to the MEDIA list.

    ./control.pl --add --source='zdf' --show='SOKO_5113'

You can also define a alternative path for a show, if the default path shouldn't be used.

    ./control.pl --add --source='zdf' --show='SOKO_5113' --path='/video/'

You can simply get all shows which you have added.

    ./control.pl --list off

A show can also be deleted from the MEDIA list.

    ./control.pl --del --source='zdf' --show='SOKO_5113'


You can get further information about the control script.
    
    ./control.pl --help


Now you can simply start the main script vom mediarip.

    ./mediarip.pl

For a perfect setup you should create a crontab entry for mediarip.pl. Doing so allows your shows to be updated fully automatically.
The example given below shows a cronjob that starts the mediarip script every 60 minutes. 

    */60 *    * * *  user  cd /path/to/mediarip/ && /path/to/mediarip/mediarip.pl
