mediarip
============

The goal of this project is, to fully automatic download videos from media libraries like 'ZDFmediathek'.
Mediarip also can transcode the downloaded files on the fly, if wanted.
You just have to define some shows, which you are interested in.
Then mediarip will automatic check for new episodes of your shows and download and transcode them,
each time the mediarip script is started.

Tip: start mediarip as cronjob for a fully automatic setup.


Dependencies
------------

- some Perl modules

    LWP::UserAgent
    DBI             # only needed, if DATA_STORE_METHOD is set to 'db' in CONFIG

- mencoder          # only needed, if CONVERT is set to 'yes' in CONFIG 
                    # builded with libmp3lame, libx264 and libxvidcore  
- mplayer


Cloning
-------

    git clone git://github.com/svenburkard/mediarip.git


Configuring
-----------

You just have to fill the CONFIG file with your values.
Some settings have dependencies to other ones.

If you use a database as DATA_STORE_METHOD, you need to create a database named 'mediarip'
and a user, which has access to this database.


Using
-----

First of all, you need to add some shows, which should be checked for new episodes from mediarip.
So you are looking for all available shows from one source.

    ./control.pl --list on

One example line of the result could be 'zdf: SOKO_5113'
Now you gonna add this entry to our MEDIA list.

    ./control.pl --add --source='zdf' --show='SOKO_5113'

You could also define a alternative path for a show, if the default path shouldn't be used.

    ./control.pl --add --source='zdf' --show='SOKO_5113' --path='/video/'

You can simply get all shows, you added.

    ./control.pl --list off

A show can also be deleted from your MEDIA list.

    ./control.pl --del --source='zdf' --show='SOKO_5113'


Further informations about the control script you got with
    
    ./control.pl --help


Now you can simply start the main script vom mediarip.

    ./mediarip.pl


For a perfect setup you should create a crontab entry for mediarip.pl, so your shows gonna updated fully automatic.
Given example shows a cronjob, that starts every 60 minutes the mediarip script.

    */60 *    * * *  user  cd /path/to/mediarip/ && /path/to/mediarip/mediarip.pl
